# Summary

This is a blower attachment for the E3D V6 hotend.
This thing mounts using the clip provided by E3D.

View an animation of this at: http://0ze.ro/fan_flap_animation.gif


Things you will need to make this:
1 - SG90 hobby servo (and screws and servo arm)
1 - M5x12 Bolt (or longer, I used M5x16)
1 - M5 Lock nut
1 - MF85ZZ bearing
4 - M3x35 Bolts
4 - M3 nuts
1 - E3D v6 hotend fan clip http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:340312
2 - 5mm long self threading screws to mount the E3D clip.
1 - 40mmx10mm fan

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: Prusa i3
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.1mm-0.2mm layer height
Infill: 80%

Notes: 
Make sure that you have retraction on and maybe make your print speed a little slower to allow it to properly print the bottom pegs for the E3D clip.

# Post-Printing

## Step 1

Clean all the parts (remove excess plastic form edges).

## Step 2

Insert the servo arm (white in pictures below) into the flap piece (orange in pictures above) and trim the excess.  See pictures.

Here it is uncut.

![Alt text](https://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/36/ce/6e/d3/f4/servo_arm_cut.png)
This is what it should look like after cutting.

## Step 3

Insert flap (orange in pictures above) into duct body (green in pictures above) and mount servo.

**Important Note:** make sure your servo is set to the 0 position (0 to 180 degrees), or -90 position (-90 to 90 degrees), and make sure the flap (orange) is completely down (closed). Use the hole on the other side of the flap (orange) to provide access to the servo arm screw.

## Step 4

Insert the MF85ZZ bearing.  Insert the M5 bolt through the bearing and flap (orange).  Secure with M5 lock nut on the inside of the duct body (green).

**Important Note:** do not use washers on the M5 bolt as they will interfere with the MF85ZZ bearing.

## Step 5

Using the 2 5mm long self tapping screws attach the E3D clip (blue) to the blower body (red).  The other 2 holes should line up the the pegs.

**Important Note:** do not over-tighten these screws.  Doing so may damage your E3D clip (blue).

## Step 6

Sandwich the fan, duct (green) and blower (red) together ensuring the flap (orange) covers the bottom airway (the one pointed at the print surface) and secure with the M3x35 bolts and M3 nuts.

## Step 7

Clip the newly assembled object to your E3D v6 hotend.  Run the wires for the fan and servo to your printer controller board.

**Important Note:**  Where to connect these and how to configure it in your firmware is beyond the scope of these instructions. 

## DISCLAIMER

**Please note that failure to assemble/connect/configure electronic components correctly can damage them.  I will not tell you how to properly connect them or configure them.  You will need to research and figure this out on your own.**
